Changes from SRL5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EVERYTHING should be recorded here: new features, function name changes, user-defined variables... everything! Everything here will be explained in the SRL6 release thread.

- The interface constants (MS, MM, MC, etc.) have been removed. Instead use minimap.x1, minimap.getBounds(), etc. See each interface file for a list of all possible attributes.
- Lape's auto-invoke has been turned off. This means when you call a function/procedure you NEED to include () at the end.
  - i.e. WRONG: walkToTrees; RIGHT: walkToTrees();
  - NOTE: This is only when writing code INSIDE SRL. You do not need to include () in your scripts if you don't want.
- Since Lape doesn't yet have addOnTerminate, we have added it to SRL; however, the only way it works properly is if you call terminateScript() at the end of your script. So, be sure to add terminateScript before the last "end." of your script.


- debug.simba (merged with SRLLog.simba)
  - Added variables disableSRLDebug, disableSRLLog, disableIPScreenshots
  - Logs are automatically saved to srl/logs/

  - SRL's debug procedure is now print('Message', debugType: TDebug = TDebug.DEBUG)
  - Valid debugTypes and debug guidlines can be found at the top of debug.simba.
  - We HIGHLY recommend adopting this system for your scripts (it's displays the same as MSI's debug if anyone has seen that system).

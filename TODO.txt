TODO

Please tag completed things with commit identities (those ugly hashes). Feel free to just add progress as well. 

Try to grep the include for TODO marks, these are mainly smaller things.

Updated: 31 Mar 2011 -- Nava2

HIGH:

- Documentation
	- Update all documentation
	- All headers should have examples, credits, and modified dates.
	- All constants, types, and vars should be documented. 
	- See amount.simba for examples of documenation
	- Try to make sure docs compile before committing them

        - Files that still need to be done
                  

- Clean up files
	- Largely, we need to remove unecessary functions. (one liners etc)

- Remove ``string-cases'', replace with constants (and document :))

- Fix Random Solvers



MED:

- Implement Hobbit's antiban system.

- Implement Luff's custom waiting settings, keyboard settings, all that jazz
	- Perhaps use an extension for all of these settings and read from a file? Would need to be fast.
	- Loading these into a ``dictionary'' of sorts would be a nice way to implement this. 

- Correct SRL Stats issues
	- fixed in Stats v1.3 --- please confirm. 







LOW:

- API setup for implementing reflection alternatives over top of SRL if needed
	- Considering moving this to SRL6 when we do the complete restructure. -- Nava2
